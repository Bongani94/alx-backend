> How to do pagination in Python?
`Send an initial request and return the response â€” this is used so we can retrieve the total number of pages before paginating. Run the pagination function â€” using the number of pages from the previous call and passing in the parameters.`
> `This module helps dividing large lists of items into pages`. The user is shown one page at a time and can navigate to other pages. Imagine you are offering a company phonebook and let the user search the entries.
